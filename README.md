# Street Guard Client

### Usage

Once you have `CS-12-Final-Project-Client` and `CS-12-Final-Project-Server` stored in a root directory and your environment fully configured, do the following:

- Open a terminal within `CS-12-Final-Project-Server` and run `npm install`. This will install all the project's node dependencies, and only needs to be done once.
- Run `npm test` to launch the server in localhost.
- Run the client app by referring to _CS-12-Final-Project-Client_.
